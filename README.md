# icecreamtruck
One of my first projects, this is a simple HTML page which has a drop down for the day of the week. Once you select a day and press the "Find the truck" button, it shows you the location of ice cream truck for that day.
The location of ice cream truck is hard-coded and being read from a JSON file.
